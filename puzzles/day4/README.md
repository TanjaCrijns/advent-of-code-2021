Day 4: Giant Squid 
---
You're already almost 1.5km (almost a mile) below the surface of the ocean, already so deep that you can't see any sunlight. What you can see, however, is a giant squid that has attached itself to the outside of your submarine.

Maybe it wants to play bingo?

Bingo is played on a set of boards each consisting of a 5x5 grid of numbers. Numbers are chosen at random, and the chosen number is marked on all boards on which it appears. (Numbers may not appear on all boards.) If all numbers in any row or any column of a board are marked, that board wins. (Diagonals don't count.)

The submarine has a bingo subsystem to help passengers (currently, you and the giant squid) pass the time. It automatically generates a random order in which to draw numbers and a random set of boards (your puzzle input). For example:
```
7,4,9,5,11,17,23,2,0,14,21,24,10,16,13,6,15,25,12,22,18,20,8,19,3,26,1

22 13 17 11  0
 8  2 23  4 24
21  9 14 16  7
 6 10  3 18  5
 1 12 20 15 19

 3 15  0  2 22
 9 18 13 17  5
19  8  7 25 23
20 11 10 24  4
14 21 16 12  6

14 21 17 24  4
10 16 15  9 19
18  8 23 26 20
22 11 13  6  5
 2  0 12  3  7
 ```
After the first five numbers are drawn (7, 4, 9, 5, and 11), there are no winners, but the boards are marked as follows (shown here adjacent to each other to save space):
````
22 13 17 11  0         3 15  0  2 22        14 21 17 24  4
 8  2 23  4 24         9 18 13 17  5        10 16 15  9 19
21  9 14 16  7        19  8  7 25 23        18  8 23 26 20
 6 10  3 18  5        20 11 10 24  4        22 11 13  6  5
 1 12 20 15 19        14 21 16 12  6         2  0 12  3  7
 ```
After the next six numbers are drawn (17, 23, 2, 0, 14, and 21), there are still no winners:
```
22 13 17 11  0         3 15  0  2 22        14 21 17 24  4
 8  2 23  4 24         9 18 13 17  5        10 16 15  9 19
21  9 14 16  7        19  8  7 25 23        18  8 23 26 20
 6 10  3 18  5        20 11 10 24  4        22 11 13  6  5
 1 12 20 15 19        14 21 16 12  6         2  0 12  3  7
 ```
Finally, 24 is drawn:
```
22 13 17 11  0         3 15  0  2 22        14 21 17 24  4
 8  2 23  4 24         9 18 13 17  5        10 16 15  9 19
21  9 14 16  7        19  8  7 25 23        18  8 23 26 20
 6 10  3 18  5        20 11 10 24  4        22 11 13  6  5
 1 12 20 15 19        14 21 16 12  6         2  0 12  3  7
 ```
At this point, the third board wins because it has at least one complete row or column of marked numbers (in this case, the entire top row is marked: 14 21 17 24 4).

The score of the winning board can now be calculated. Start by finding the sum of all unmarked numbers on that board; in this case, the sum is 188. Then, multiply that sum by the number that was just called when the board won, 24, to get the final score, 188 * 24 = 4512.

To guarantee victory against the giant squid, figure out which board will win first. What will your final score be if you choose that board?

#### Part Two 

Based on your calculations, the planned course doesn't seem to make any sense. You find the submarine manual and discover that the process is actually slightly more complicated.

In addition to horizontal position and depth, you'll also need to track a third value, aim, which also starts at 0. The commands also mean something entirely different than you first thought:
```
down X increases your aim by X units.
up X decreases your aim by X units.
forward X does two things:
It increases your horizontal position by X units.
It increases your depth by your aim multiplied by X.
````
Again note that since you're on a submarine, down and up do the opposite of what you might expect: "down" means aiming in the positive direction.

Now, the above example does something different:

- forward 5 adds 5 to your horizontal position, a total of 5. Because your aim is 0, your depth does not change.
- down 5 adds 5 to your aim, resulting in a value of 5.
- forward 8 adds 8 to your horizontal position, a total of 13. Because your aim is 5, your depth increases by 8*5=40.
- up 3 decreases your aim by 3, resulting in a value of 2.
- down 8 adds 8 to your aim, resulting in a value of 10.
- forward 2 adds 2 to your horizontal position, a total of 15. Because your aim is 10, your depth increases by 2*10=20 to a total of 60.
After following these new instructions, you would have a horizontal position of 15 and a depth of 60. (Multiplying these produces 900.)

Using this new interpretation of the commands, calculate the horizontal position and depth you would have after following the planned course. What do you get if you multiply your final horizontal position by your final depth?

  Naive but quick solution. Learned something about how Julia deals with global variables.
